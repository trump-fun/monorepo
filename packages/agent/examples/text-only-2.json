  "content": "<p>Working together with a fantastic and very talented Executive Residence Staff, along with the wonderful people at the National Park Service, we are making tremendous enhancements to the White House, thereby preserving and protecting History! One of the interesting dilemmas is a tree planted many years ago by the Legendary President and General, Andrew Jackson. It is a Southern Magnolia, that came from his home, The Hermitage, in Tennessee. Thatâ€™s the good news! The bad news is that everything must come to an end, and this tree is in terrible condition, a very dangerous safety hazard, at the White House Entrance, no less, and must now be removed. This process will take place next week, and will be replaced by another, very beautiful tree. The Historic wood from the tree will be preserved by the White House Staff, and may be used for other high and noble purposes!!!</p>",
