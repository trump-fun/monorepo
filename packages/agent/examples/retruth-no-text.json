      "content": "<p>Here is the fatal flaw with DC Obama Judge Jeb Boasberg's order:</p><p>Even if these designated foreign terrorists are entitled to individual court review before their deportation, which is disputed, the DC court is not the proper court.</p><p>Judge Boasberg did not, and does not, have the power to do what he is purporting to do. For this reason alone, everything he is doing is lawless. But it is much worse; it is also dangerous.</p><p>Judge Boasberg ran to his courtroom to hold a Saturday hearing, even though he was not even serving as the emergency judge that weekend. (How did he get this case?) He publicly exposed an ongoing U.S. military, intelligence, and law-enforcement operation with an American ally dealing with the most vicious terrorists (Tren de Aragua) and international gang member (MS13) in the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>That public exposure put American and allied lives in grave danger.</p><p>Stunningly, Judge Boasberg even ordered the President to turn around planes full of terrorists over the Gulf of America, without knowing the fuel levels, the security footprint back in America, or other crucial operational details.</p><p>We saw the enormous security footprint in El Salvador. Why would we have had that same footprint in America, as who could have ever imagined an activist DC judge could or would order the President to return planes full of terrorists?</p><p>And not completing the mission would have humiliated and politically damaged El Salvador's president, who had hundreds of military, law-enforcement, and other officials awaiting--and who took a significant political and personal risk by agreeing to take these terrorists.</p><p>Judge Boasberg's Saturday hearing and order crossed the red line. But Judge Boasberg is doubling down by demanding details about the military operation, to which he is not entitled. Judge Boasberg says he has a security clearance, but he definitely does not have the need to know. And allowing judges to meddle in military operations like this is dangerous and unacceptable.</p><p>Foreign leaders are less likely to work with the President, if they fear an activist American judge may disclose their secrets. This harms the Presidentâ€™s ability to conduct foreign policy and his constitutional duty to keep us safe.</p><p>The President has a constitutional duty, as the chief executive officer and commander-in-chief, to conduct international affairs, repeal foreign invasion, and protect American lives. The President has a constitutional duty to ignore any clearly unlawful court order that imminently endangers American lives, like Judge Boasberg's orders.</p><p>Judge Boasberg is refusing to back down. So the House must move forward with impeachment proceedings for his lawless and dangerous sabotage of the President's core Article II powers.</p><p><a href=\"https://x.com/kyledcheney/status/1904170983352672315\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://</span><span class=\"ellipsis\">x.com/kyledcheney/status/19041</span><span class=\"invisible\">70983352672315</span></a></p>",
