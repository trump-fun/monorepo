# Source Tracing Agent Proposal

## Overview

The Source Tracing Agent finds where information originally came from by following links backwards through the internet. Think of it like a detective that traces claims back to their source to see if they're trustworthy.

## Value Proposition

- Finds the original source of claims
- Tells you how reliable each source is
- Shows you the path from one article to another
- Helps spot misinformation

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Link Following**

   - Follows links from one page to another
   - Picks which links are worth checking
   - Grabs the important content from pages
   - Plays nice with websites (doesn't overload them)

2. **Source Checking**

   - Figures out what kind of source it is (news, social media, etc.)
   - Rates how trustworthy it is
   - Shows how information spread from one place to another
   - Checks if it's from a known reliable source

3. **Content Handling**
   - Reads different types of content (text, PDFs, etc.)
   - Shows you how information flowed between sources
   - Organizes everything clearly
   - Saves results to speed things up

### Technical Requirements

- TypeScript/Node.js environment
- 8GB RAM recommended
- Storage for caching
- API keys for:
  - Firecrawl (web crawling)
  - Tavily (search intelligence)
  - An LLM (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google)

### Implementation Stack

- TypeScript + Node.js core
- LangChain + LangGraph for agent logic
- Firecrawl for web crawling and content extraction
- Tavily for intelligent search
- Cheerio & Puppeteer for fallback parsing
- Zod for data validation

## Example Output

```json
{
  "originalUrl": "https://news-site.com/article123",
  "referenceChain": [
    {
      "url": "https://news-site.com/article123",
      "type": "news_article",
      "reliability": 0.75,
      "extracted_date": "2025-04-23T10:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "url": "https://research-institute.org/study456",
      "type": "academic_paper",
      "reliability": 0.95,
      "extracted_date": "2025-04-23T10:00:01Z"
    }
  ],
  "primarySource": {
    "url": "https://government.gov/official-release789",
    "type": "government_document",
    "reliability": 0.98,
    "verification_status": "confirmed"
  },
  "confidenceScore": 0.92,
  "processingTime": "1.5s"
}
```

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1 (1-2 months)

- Core crawling infrastructure
- Basic source classification
- Content extraction system

### Phase 2 (2-3 months)

- Advanced source assessment
- Chain reliability scoring
- Performance optimization

### Phase 3 (3-4 months)

- Browser extension development
