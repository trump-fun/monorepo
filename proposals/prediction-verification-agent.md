# Prediction Verification Agent Proposal

## Overview

The Prediction Verification Agent checks if predictions came true by looking at real-world data. It gathers evidence from different sources like news articles, and social media to figure out if someone's prediction was right or wrong.

## Value Proposition

- Automatically checks if predictions came true
- Looks at multiple sources to be thorough
- Shows how sure we are about the results
- Keeps track of who makes good predictions

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Finding Evidence**

   - Looks up information from different places
   - Checks when things happened
   - Rates how trustworthy each source is

2. **Checking Results**

   - Figures out if predictions came true
   - Connects different pieces of evidence
   - Shows how confident we are in the result
   - Knows when to check for results

3. **Organizing Results**
   - Creates easy-to-read reports
   - Saves links to all the evidence
   - Keeps track of everything over time

### Technical Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- Bun runtime
- 4GB RAM minimum
- API access to:
  - Tavily
  - Datura
  - An LLM (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google)

### Implementation Stack

- TypeScript + Bun
- LangChain/LangGraph for verification logic
- Tavily for search intelligence
- Datura API for social media verification

## Example Output

```json
{
  "prediction_text": "Tesla stock will reach $300 by end of 2023",
  "prediction_date": "2023-01-15",
  "prediction_source": "https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1234567890",
  "predictor_username": "elonmusk",
  "matured": true,
  "outcome": "incorrect",
  "confidence_score": 0.95,
  "evidence_urls": ["https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/history/"],
  "evidence_text": "Tesla stock reached a high of $248.48 in 2023, failing to reach the $300 prediction",
  "verification_date": "2024-01-05"
}
```
