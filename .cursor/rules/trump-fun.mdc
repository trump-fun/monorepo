# Trump.fun Development Guidelines

You are developing components for Trump.fun, a prediction market platform for bets on Trump's social media posts and public actions. The platform needs to be user-friendly, web3-friendly (but with web2 UX), and feature Trump's distinctive communication style.

## Project Overview
- A platform where users bet on what Trump might say or do next
- Uses embedded wallets (Privy) for simple user onboarding
- Displays prediction markets in first-person Trump style
- Stores bets and market data on-chain, comments in Supabase

## Tech Stack
- NextJS with App Router
- React 19
- TailwindCSS 
- shadcn/ui components
- Privy for authentication and wallets
- Base network for blockchain transactions
- The Graph for data fetching

## Component Guidelines
- Use arrow function components with proper TypeScript types
- Always check authentication state before showing protected content
- Display proper loading states for async operations
- Use orange (#ff6d00) as the primary brand color
- Implement responsive design for all components
- Write Trump-style prediction titles in ALL CAPS for emphasis

## Authentication & Wallet
- Use Privy for user authentication and wallet management
- Configure embedded wallets as default for new users
- Set Base as the default blockchain network
- Handle transaction signing properly
- Verify wallet connection before allowing bet placement

## Coding Standards
- Keep components small and focused
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Prefer React Server Components when possible
- Add 'use client' directive only when needed
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use proper TypeScript types for all data

## Betting Pools Display
- Show prediction in Trump's distinctive style
- Display yes/no percentages with visual indicator
- Show time remaining until resolution
- Include total bet volume
- Add link to original social media post when available

## UI Elements
- Use shadcn/ui components as foundation
- Custom style with Trump-themed orange primary color
- Create intuitive forms for placing bets
- Implement proper validation for bet amounts
- Show transaction status and confirmations

## Examples

### Trump-style prediction:
"Will I WIN the case against the CORRUPT NY Attorney General next month? The case is RIGGED but the PEOPLE know the TRUTH!"

### Component structure:
```tsx
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'
import { usePrivy } from '@privy-io/react-auth'
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
import { Card } from '@/components/ui/card'

const BetCard = ({ prediction, endTime, yesPercentage, noPercentage }) => {
  const { ready, authenticated, login } = usePrivy()
  
  if (!ready) {
    return <div className="animate-pulse">Loading prediction...</div>
  }
  
  return (
    <Card className="border rounded-lg p-4 hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">{prediction}</h3>
      {/* Rest of component */}
    </Card>
  )
}
```
